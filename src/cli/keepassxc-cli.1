.SH COMMANDS

.IP "clip [options] <database> <entry> [timeout]"
Copies the password of a database entry to the clipboard. If multiple entries with the same name exist in different groups, only the password for the first one is going to be copied. For copying the password of an entry in a specific group, the group path to the entry should be specified as well, instead of just the name. Optionally, a timeout in seconds can be specified to automatically clear the clipboard.

.IP "entropy-meter [-a pwd1 pwd2 ...]"
Calculates the entropy of a single, or multiple passwords specified using the \fI-a\fP option. If no passwords are specified, the program will run in interactive mode and prompt the user to enter a password.

.IP "merge [options] <database1> <database2>"
