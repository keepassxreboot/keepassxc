== NAME
keepassxc-cli - command line interface for the KeePassXC password manager

== SYNOPSIS
*keepassxc-cli* _command_ [_options_]

== DESCRIPTION
*keepassxc-cli* is the command line interface for the *KeePassXC* password manager.
It provides the ability to query and modify the entries of a KeePass database, directly from the command line.

== COMMANDS
*add* [_options_] <__database__> <__entry__>::
  Adds a new entry to a database.
  A password can be generated (*-g* option), or a prompt can be displayed to input the password (*-p* option).
  The same password generation options as documented for the generate command can be used when the *-g* option is set.

*analyze* [_options_] <__database__>::
  Analyzes passwords in a database for weaknesses using offline HIBP SHA-1 hash lookup.

*clip* [_options_] <__database__> <__entry__> [_timeout_]::
  Copies an attribute or the current TOTP (if the *-t* option is specified) of a database entry to the clipboard.
  If no attribute name is specified using the *-a* option, the password is copied.
  If multiple entries with the same name exist in different groups, only the attribute for the first one is copied.
  For copying the attribute of an entry in a specific group, the group path to the entry should be specified as well, instead of just the name.
  Optionally, a timeout in seconds can be specified to automatically clear the clipboard.

*close*::
  In interactive mode, closes the currently opened database (see *open*).

*db-create* [_options_] <__database__>::
  Creates a new database with a password and/or a key file.
  The key file will be created if the file that is referred to does not exist.
  If both the key file and password are empty, no database will be created.

*db-info* [_options_] <__database__>::
  Show a database's information.

*diceware* [_options_]::
  Generates a random diceware passphrase.

*edit* [_options_] <__database__> <__entry__>::
  Edits a database entry.
  A password can be generated (*-g* option), or a prompt can be displayed to input the password (*-p* option).
  The same password generation options as documented for the generate command can be used when the *-g* option is set.

*estimate* [_options_] [_password_]::
  Estimates the entropy of a password.
  The password to estimate can be provided as a positional argument, or using the standard input.

*exit*::
  Exits interactive mode.
  Synonymous with *quit*.

*export* [_options_] <__database__>::
  Exports the content of a database to standard output in the specified format (defaults to XML).

*generate* [_options_]::
  Generates a random password.

*help* [_command_]::
  Displays a list of available commands, or detailed information about the specified command.

*import* [_options_] <__xml__> <__database__>::
  Imports the contents of an XML exported database to a new created database
  with a password and/or key file.
  The key file will be created if the file that is referred to does not exist.
  If both the key file and password are empty, no database will be created.
  The new database will be in kdbx 4 format.


*locate* [_options_] <__database__> <__term__>::
  Locates all the entries that match a specific search term in a database.

*ls* [_options_] <__database__> [_group_]::
  Lists the contents of a group in a database.
  If no group is specified, it will default to the root group.

*merge* [_options_] <__database1__> <__database2__>::
  Merges two databases together.
  The first database file is going to be replaced by the result of the merge, for that reason it is advisable to keep a backup of the two database files before attempting a merge.
  In the case that both databases make use of the same credentials, the *--same-credentials* or *-s* option can be used.

*mkdir* [_options_] <__database__> <__group__>::
  Adds a new group to a database.

*mv* [_options_] <__database__> <__entry__> <__group__>::
  Moves an entry to a new group.

*open* [_options_] <__database__>::
  Opens the given database in a shell-style interactive mode.
  This is useful for performing multiple operations on a single database (e.g. *ls* followed by *show*).

*quit*::
  Exits interactive mode.
  Synonymous with *exit*.

*rm* [_options_] <__database__> <__entry__>::
  Removes an entry from a database.
  If the database has a recycle bin, the entry will be moved there.
  If the entry is already in the recycle bin, it will be removed permanently.

*rmdir* [_options_] <__database__> <__group__>::
  Removes a group from a database.
  If the database has a recycle bin, the group will be moved there.
  If the group is already in the recycle bin, it will be removed permanently.

*show* [_options_] <__database__> <__entry__>::
  Shows the title, username, password, URL and notes of a database entry.
  Can also show the current TOTP.
  Regarding the occurrence of multiple entries with the same name in different groups, everything stated in the *clip* command section also applies here.

== OPTIONS
=== General options
*--debug-info*::
  Displays debugging information.

*-k*, *--key-file* <__path__>::
  Specifies a path to a key file for unlocking the database.

*--no-password*::
  Deactivates the password key for the database.

*-y*, *--yubikey* <__slot__>::
  Specifies a yubikey slot for unlocking the database.
  In a merge operation this option is used to specify the YubiKey slot for the first database.
