== Setup Browser Integration
The KeePassXC-Browser extension is installed within your web browser so that you can automatically pull usernames and passwords from KeePassXC and populate them directly into website fields.

The KeePassXC-Browser extension is available on the following web browsers:

* Google Chrome, Vivaldi, and Brave
* Mozilla Firefox and Tor-Browser
* Microsoft Edge
* Chromium
