== Setup Browser Integration
The KeePassXC-Browser extension is installed within your web browser so that you can automatically pull usernames and passwords from KeePassXC and populate them directly into website fields. It is a very useful and secure extension that enhances your productivity while using KeePassXC.

The KeePassXC-Browser extension is available on the following web browsers:

* Google Chrome, Vivaldi, and Brave
* Mozilla Firefox and Tor-Browser
* Microsoft Edge
* Chromium

=== Configure KeePassXC-Browser
To start using KeePassXC-Browser, you must configure it so that it can communicate with the KeePassXC application on your desktop.

To configure KeePassXC-Browser, perform the following steps:

1. Open the KeePassXC application on your desktop and navigate to Tools > Settings.

2. Click the Browser Integration option on the left-hand side *(1)*. The following screen appears:

WARNING: If you reuse a connection name in a database, the previous browser connection will be overwritten and prevent access.

=== Using the Browser Extension
The KeePassXC-Browser extension lets you automatically populate the entries from your KeePassXC database into the fields on websites you visit. To do so, perform the following steps:

1. Open your KeePassXC desktop application and unlock your database.

2. Open your web browser. The KeePassXC-Browser extension icon in your browser window will change based on its connection state. The figure below shows the different states.
+
*(A)* KeePassXC is not running or is disconnected. +
*(B)* KeePassXC is running, but KeePassXC Browser Extension is not connected to the current database. +
*\(C)* Connected to KeePassXC, but database is locked. +
*(D)* Connected to KeePassXC and ready to use. If the icon is shown with a number, it indicates the number of credentials found for the current site.

=== Generate Passwords

The KeePassXC-Browser Extension also lets you generate passwords directly in your browser. 
This feature can be used for websites with existing credentials as well as for new websites. 
You can then choose to update/add the credentials to your KeePassXC database directly from the Browser.

1. Ensure your database is unlocked and configured to use the Browser extension as shown above.

2. Right click on a password field and from the KeePassXC sub-menu choose _Show Password Generator_. The standard KeePassXC password generator will appear.

3. Configure the password generation options and click _Apply Password_ when done. The generated password will be filled into the previously selected field.

4. When you have successfully submitted the password on the website, a popup will appear asking you to either update an existing entry or add a new one.

=== Browser statistics
You can see a cross-section of all browser-related settings applied to entries within a database through the Browser Statistics report. To access these, use the _Database_ -> _Database reports..._ menu option then click on _Browser Statistics_ on the left-hand menu. From here you can see all entries with URLs applied to them, explicitly allowed and denied URLs, and any entries with custom browser settings.

=== Advanced Usage
You can configure unique browser integration behavior for each entry. This allows you to add multiple URLs to an entry, hide an entry from the browser integration, and more. To access these settings, open an entry for editing then click on _Browser Integration_ option in the left-hand menu *(1)*.

After opening the settings you can add any number of additional URLs by clicking the _Add_ button *(2)* and typing the URL in the list to the left *(3)*.

.Entry browser settings
image::browser_entry_settings.png[]

To set options for all entries within a group, edit the group and go to the browser integration section *(1)*. Here you can explicitly disable access to all entries under a group hierarchy to the browser extension. You can set other useful options for groups of entries as well.

.Group browser settings
image::browser_group_settings.png[]

Database-wide operations are available in the database settings. To access these use the _Database_ -> _Database settings..._ menu option. Click on _Browser Integration_ on the left-hand menu. From here you can disconnect all browsers, convert legacy KeePass-HTTP settings, reset all entry-level settings, and refresh the database root group ID (useful when making copies of your database file).

Finally, advanced application-wide settings are available in the Browser Integration tab of the application settings.

WARNING: We do not recommend changing any of these settings as they may break the browser integration plugin.

=== Advanced Setup

==== Custom Browser option

It is possible to enable support for a custom browser (e.g. LibreWolf, WaterFox, Arc, beta and nightly browsers, etc.) using this feature.
This feature is only available for Linux and macOS.

.Custom browser configuration
image::browser_custom_browser_configuration.png[]

The native messaging script file needed for the custom browser depends on the browser type. For Firefox based browsers like Librefox the _Browser type_ must be _Firefox_. For Arc, Opera, etc. the type must be set to _Chromium_.

_Config location_ must have the exact path for the browser's _native-messaging-hosts_ folder. If you are unsure, refer to our https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc-browser/wiki/Troubleshooting-guide#1-after-enabling-browser-integration-and-support-for-your-browser[Troubleshooting Guide] for listing of the most common paths, and a few ways for finding a path when it's not known.

When a Custom Browser has been successfully set, KeePassXC will automatically write the needed native messaging script file to the folder.

If you wish to support multiple custom browsers, you can copy the native messaging script files manually to the _native-messaging-hosts_ folder from other browsers.

==== Managed Microsoft Edge on Windows
1. Deploy *org.keepassxc.keepassxc_browser_edge.json* to, for example, `C:\ProgramData\KeepassXC` on all managed platforms.
