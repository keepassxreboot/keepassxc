# - Enable Code Coverage
#
# 2013-09-17, Joakim Söderberg
# - Added support for Clang.
# - Some additional usage instructions.
#
# USAGE:

# 0. (Mac only) If you use Xcode 5.1 make sure to patch geninfo as described here:
#      http://stackoverflow.com/a/22404544/80480
#
# 1. Copy this file into your cmake modules path.
#
# 2. Add the following line to your CMakeLists.txt:
#      INCLUDE(CodeCoverage)
#
# 3. Set compiler flags to turn off optimization and enable coverage:
#    SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-g -O0 -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage")
#	 SET(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "-g -O0 -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage")
#
# 3. Use the function SETUP_TARGET_FOR_COVERAGE to create a custom make target
#    which runs your test executable and produces a lcov code coverage report:
#    Example:
#	 SETUP_TARGET_FOR_COVERAGE(
#				my_coverage_target  # Name for custom target.
#				test_driver         # Name of the test driver executable that runs the tests.
#									# NOTE! This should always have a ZERO as exit code
#									# otherwise the coverage generation will not complete.
#				coverage            # Name of output directory.
#				)
#
# 4. Build a Debug build:
#	 cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
#	 make
#	 make my_coverage_target
#
#

# Check prereqs
